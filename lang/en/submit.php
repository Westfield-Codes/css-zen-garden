			"Which means continuing to add new designs is more fun than necessary. In 2013 for its tenth anniversary, I revived it with an <abbr title=\"HyperText Markup Language 5\">HTML5</abbr> and <abbr title=\"Cascading Style Sheets Level 3\">CSS3</abbr> makeover &#8212; but only on the realization that the lasting educational value of the <abbr>CSS</abbr> Zen Garden was rapidly ageing past relevance given its earlier <abbr title=\"eXtensible HyperText Markup Language\">XHTML</abbr> and <abbr title=\"Cascading Style Sheets Level 2\">CSS2</abbr> roots. While the refresh was primarily intended to keep this a relevant learning tool for newer generations, we also added a handful of community submissions and a generous <a href=\"https://fonts.adobe.com/\">TypeKit</a> sponsorship by <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/\">Adobe</a> to breath some new life in it.",

			"I&#8217;ll never say no to great work, but at this point a design submission would have to be exceptional and meet or exceed the visual quality, creativity, and thoughtfulness of the most recent 10 or so to be considered. It would also have to exhibit technical excellence, filled with cutting edge <abbr>CSS</abbr> techniques used in a way that renders well across a range of browsers and devices.",

			"If that sounds like a challenge you&#8217;re up for and you have a submission to show me&#8230; <a href=\"https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com\">I&#8217;m listening</a>."
